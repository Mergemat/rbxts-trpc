description: Build type-safe game RPC and events with one shared router.

`rbxts-trpc` brings tRPC-style contracts to Roblox TS.

Use one router definition to generate:

- Client procedure and event proxies
- Server request handlers and emitters
- End-to-end types for inputs, outputs, and context

## Why this library

- **Single source of truth:** one router defines client/server behavior
- **Runtime safety:** validators catch bad payloads at boundaries
- **Game-ready flow:** call procedures and stream state changes via events
- **React support:** optional hooks for UI-driven querying and mutation
